srrDB uploader
==============

This repository contains my own uploader for https://www.srrdb.com: ``srrdb.py``,
along with a collection of other scripts from various people.

Next to uploading *.srr* files, it allows you to add files to the correct 
release page without needing to have a .srr file. This is useful for
backfilling .srs files in batch.

Other scripts
-------------

This list of other scripts is not maintained by myself and can be out of date.
Let me know of any improvements to apply.	

- srrup.pl: SRR uploader written in Perl
- srrup.sh: SRR uploader written in Bash
- rTorrent: contains Perl script that will create and upload SRRs to srrDB 
  after a torrent completes. Needs to be added to ``.rtorrent.rc``.

- ruTorrent: a plugin for the ruTorrent webinterface to manually create and 
  upload an SRR with a click. Useful when completing missing files afterwards.
